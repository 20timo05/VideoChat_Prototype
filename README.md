## Motivation
This is a simple implementation of a Group Video Chat Application. The motivation is to build out a prototype, alongside which I can later implement the Video Chat capabilities for my [Instagram-Clone Project](https://github.com/20timo05/Instagram-Clone).

## Technologies & Architecture
* I employed [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) for real-time communication instead of [socket.io](https://socket.io/), because [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) currently does not support Next.js Applications with these custom server functionalities necessary for socket.io as described in this [Stack Overflow Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70612620).
* [Simple Peer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-peer) is used as an easy-to-use Wrapper library of WebRTC to enable Peer-to-Peer connections between users. In this simple prototype, I used a Mesh-Network-Architecture, which does not scale well. However, it does not require much computing server-side and therefore is sufficient for this application.
